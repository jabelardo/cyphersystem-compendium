Floating along, the sphere attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. It can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is attached to a machine and that machine takes damage, the sphere moves to repair the damage with sophisticated tools that restore [[/r 1d6 &ndash; 2]] points per round (meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round). This requires no action on the part of the machine being repaired. The sphere can attempt to repair a machine a number of times per day equal to its level. The sphere must be newly activated each day.</p>\n<p><strong>Depletion:</strong> 1 in 1d100</p>","showDescription":false,"level":"1d6 + 2","archived":false,"recursions":[],"tags":[],"rollButton":{"pool":"Pool","skill":"Practiced","assets":0,"effort1":0,"effort2":0,"effort3":0,"stepModifier":"eased","additionalSteps":0,"additionalCost":0,"damage":0,"damagePerLOE":3,"teen":"","bonus":0},"version":1,"depletion":"1 in [[/r 1d100]]","identified":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"k2TkElLx959B0lm5":3},"flags":{},"_id":"4sk825DOsE6oE9d3"}
