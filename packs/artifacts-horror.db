These shadows coalesce into a form that best represents a deep fear in the subconscious of the person who opened the box. The opener must make an Intellect defense roll to master the shadow thing, which then acts as a level 7 creature under their control for five rounds before fading away. If the roll fails, the creature attacks the opener and anyone else around. To make matters worse, the opener spends the first round frozen in terror, doing nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Depletion:</strong> 1&ndash;2 in 1d6</p>","showDescription":false,"level":"7","archived":false,"recursions":[],"tags":[],"rollButton":{"pool":"Pool","skill":"Practiced","assets":0,"effort1":0,"effort2":0,"effort3":0,"stepModifier":"eased","additionalSteps":0,"additionalCost":0,"damage":0,"damagePerLOE":3,"teen":"","bonus":0},"version":1,"depletion":"1–2 in [[/r 1d6]]","identified":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"k2TkElLx959B0lm5":3},"flags":{},"_id":"WcrjZgKzg5VzkFVJ"}

The spell&rsquo;s effect varies, but it is always some kind of horrible attack&mdash;a target is driven mad, a target is turned inside out, a target seeks to murder their best friend, several targets are cursed with a rotting disease, and so forth. The reader can automatically cast the spell as an action, one time only. More insidiously, if successful, the spell confers pleasure to the caster and fully restores all of their Pools. The caster must make an immediate Intellect defense roll or be compelled to use the book (and thus a new spell) again the next day. This compulsion is so strong that the caster will kill their dearest loved one to complete the task. If they are unable to use the book again, they are driven permanently mad. Woe to the caster who uses the book on the last time before it is depleted (at which point it crumbles to dust).</p>\n<p><strong>Depletion:</strong> 1 in 1d10</p>","showDescription":false,"level":"8","archived":false,"recursions":[],"tags":[],"rollButton":{"pool":"Pool","skill":"Practiced","assets":0,"effort1":0,"effort2":0,"effort3":0,"stepModifier":"eased","additionalSteps":0,"additionalCost":0,"damage":0,"damagePerLOE":3,"teen":"","bonus":0},"version":1,"depletion":"1 in [[/r 1d10]]","identified":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"k2TkElLx959B0lm5":3},"flags":{},"_id":"irCnETBwvUwp12PH"}

The wish can be anything, including something that bends reality: raising the dead, altering time, and so forth.
