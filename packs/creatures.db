Some ghosts can kill victims with fear. A ghost with this ability can attack all creatures within short range with a psychic display so horrible that targets who fail an Intellect defense roll take 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and become terrified, freezing in place. In each subsequent round, a terrified victim can attempt an Intellect-based task to push away the fright. Each failed attempt moves the victim one step down the damage track. Not attempting to clear one&rsquo;s mind of fear counts as a failed attempt. Those killed by fear are marked by expressions of horror and hair that has turned white.</p>\n<p>A ghost can move through solid objects of up to level 7 at will, although it can choose to pick up and manipulate objects if it focuses on them. Ghosts can also go into a state of apparent non-existence for hours or days at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Some ghosts are talkative, some don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re dead, some want help for a task they failed to accomplish in life, and some only rage against the living and want to bring those who yet breathe into the same colorless existence they endure.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> A ghost (that at first appears fully human) wants help in eradicating a guild of ghost hunters that has targeted it and a few others haunting an abandoned structure.

{"_id":"37pnRQFiOHt47hFP","name":"Vampire","type":"NPC","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"version":1,"biography":"<p>Vampires are undead creatures, risen from the grave to drink blood. Their very nature and essence are evil and anti-life, even as they revel in their own endless existence. Most vampires are vain, arrogant, sadistic, lustful, and domineering. Their powers allow them to manipulate others, and they frequently toy with their prey before feeding. Vampires come out only at night, as the sun&rsquo;s rays will destroy them.</p>\n<p>The bite of a vampire over three nights (in which it exchanges a bit of its own blood) ensures that the victim will rise as a vampire under the thrall of the one that killed it. While vampires are careful not to create too many of their kind (which amount to competition), each thrall conveys a bit more supernatural power to a vampire.</p>\n<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Thirsts for blood</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Usually solitary, on the edges of civilization</p>\n<p><strong>Health:</strong> 24</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 7 points</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Long</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Climb, stealth, and perception as level 8; Speed defense as level 7 due to fast movement</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Vampires are strong and fast. They have impressive fangs, but these are usually used in feeding, not in battle. They typically fight with their fists or hands (which basically become claws) but sometimes use weapons.</p>\n<p>A vampire can change into a bat or a wolf. This transformation does not change its stats or abilities except that, as a bat, it can fly. Vampires can also transform into shadow or mist, and in these forms they can&rsquo;t be harmed by anything (but also can&rsquo;t affect the physical world).</p>\n<p>Vampires possess an unholy charisma and can mesmerize victims within immediate distance so that they stand motionless for one round. In subsequent rounds, the victim will not forcibly resist the vampire, and the vampire can suggest actions to the victim (even actions that will cause the victim to harm themselves or others they care about). Each round, the victim can attempt a new Intellect defense roll to break free.</p>\n<p>Vampires are notoriously difficult to hurt. Unless a weapon is very special (blessed by a saint, has specific magical enchantments against vampires, or the like), no physical attack harms a vampire. They simply don&rsquo;t take the damage. Exceptions include the following:</p>\n<p><em>Fire:</em> Vampires burn, though the damage doesn&rsquo;t kill them. It only causes pain, and a vampire regains all health lost to fire damage within a day.</p>\n<p><em>Running water:</em> Complete immersion inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire can use a single action to regain all health lost in this way.</p>\n<p><em>Holy water:</em> This inflicts 4 points of damage and affects a vampire exactly like fire.</p>\n<p><em>Sunlight:</em> Exposure to sunlight inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire regains all health lost to exposure within a day.</p>\n<p><em>Wooden stake:</em> This weapon inflicts 25 points of damage, effectively destroying the vampire in one blow. However, if the vampire is aware and able to move, this attack is hindered as the vampire does everything it can to evade.</p>\n<p>Further, vampires have the following special weaknesses:</p>\n<p><em>Garlic:</em> Significant amounts of garlic within immediate distance hinder a vampire&rsquo;s tasks.</p>\n<p><em>Cross, holy symbol, or mirror:</em> Presenting any of these objects forcefully stuns a vampire, causing it to lose its next action. While the object is brandished and the vampire is within immediate range, its tasks are hindered by two steps.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a vampire with a multitude under its command becomes the new vampire lord. The vampire lord is the most powerful vampire in the world and is often (but not always) the most ancient of its kind. It has many vampires under its control, and even those that it did not create pay it respect and homage.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Most vampires look upon humans as cattle upon which to feed.

Leapfrogging technological prowess by mentally commandeering the know-how of every new species they encountered using their stolen space vessel, the aliens fashioned the Enthraller Dominion, which stretches across vast swaths of space, cemented by the psychic control.</p>\n<p>Individual enthrallers are scary, but enthraller overlords are even more powerful thanks to technological aids. These include cranial circlets that give a single enthraller governor the ability to dominate a small city, solar-system-sized ring relays that boost their control across interstellar distances, and more.</p>\n<p>Recently, a newly contacted species of aliens developed the technological means to resist the mental influence of the enthrallers. Now war bubbles across the Enthraller Dominion. Sometimes individual enthrallers, stripped of their technological enhancements as a consequence of this war, flee into virgin space, looking for new soldiers to dominate.</p>\n<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Domination of other creatures</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Almost anywhere, alone or in groups of three</p>\n<p><strong>Health:</strong> 18</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 4 points; see Combat</p>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong> 1</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Short</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Speed defense as level 4; perception and ability to detect falsehoods as level 8</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> An enthraller usually relies on dominated minions to make physical attacks on its behalf. An enthraller can make a psychic attack on a creature within short range. On a failed Intellect defense roll, the target acts as the enthraller mentally commands on its next action. If the same target is affected by this dominating attack a second time within a minute, the enthraller&rsquo;s mental control lasts for one minute.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, as its action, an enthraller can emit a psychic burst that can target up to three creatures in short range. On a failed Intellect defense roll, a victim suffers 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and is unable to take actions on their subsequent turn. If the victim is attacked while so stunned, their defense rolls are hindered by two steps.</p>\n<p>The enthraller&rsquo;s attack is a form of mental feeding. If it moves a PC down the damage track, the creature regains 4 points of health.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> An enthraller can communicate telepathically with characters within short range. It tries to mentally dominate whoever it runs across and will negotiate only with characters who are strong enough to harm it. Even if an enthraller makes a deal, it eventually reneges if it senses any advantage for doing so because it implicitly believes that other creatures are cattle.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> A spacecraft (or perhaps an escape pod) crash lands.

Even if the image is defaced, the mokuren merely &ldquo;burrows&rdquo; away and reappears like graffiti on a new flat space within a few miles.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, it could emerge from the image and become a physical cat-sized creature as a move. In this form, a mokuren can attack with its claws or bite. It can also direct a stream of fire from its glowing tail at a target within long range. (When a mokuren flies, it&rsquo;s by using its tail to create a jet that rockets it skyward.)</p>\n<p>Finally, it can make an enlarged attack, in which it swells to the size of a bus and swipes at, bites, or lands on a target as part of the same action. When enlarged, the mokuren gains +5 to Armor and makes and defends against all attacks as a level 7 creature. On a hit, the enlarged mokuren deals 7 points of damage. However, a mokuren can remain enlarged for a total of only four rounds during any twenty-four-hour period, so it uses this ability sparingly or only when enraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> To see an active mokuren is considered good luck, unless you manage to get on the wrong side of one.

Depending on a zombie&rsquo;s origin, the reason for its transformation varies. A zombie might arise from an undead curse, a psychic possession, an AI meatware overwrite, a viral infection, a drug overdose, or something else. Regardless of how the transformation happened, the result is much the same: a creature whose humanity has been burned out and replaced with unquenchable hunger.</p>\n<p>Zombies aren&rsquo;t intelligent, but enough of them together sometimes exhibit emergent behavior, just as ants can coordinate activities across a colony. Thus, zombies alone or in small groups aren&rsquo;t an overwhelming threat for someone who has a baseball bat or can get away. But it&rsquo;s never wise to laugh off a zombie horde.</p>\n<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Hunger (for flesh, cerebrospinal fluid, certain human hormones, and so on)</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Almost anywhere, in groups of five to seven, or in hordes of tens to hundreds</p>\n<p><strong>Health:</strong> 12</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 3 points</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Immediate</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Speed defense as level 2</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Zombies never turn away from a conflict. They fight on, no matter the odds, usually attacking by biting, but sometimes by tearing with hands made into claws by the erosion of skin over their finger bones.</p>\n<p>When zombies attack in groups of five to seven individuals, they can make a single attack roll against one target as one level 5 creature, inflicting 5 points of damage.</p>\n<p>Zombies are hard to finish off. If an attack would reduce a zombie&rsquo;s health to 0, it does so only if the number rolled in the attack was an even number; otherwise, the zombie is reduced to 1 point of health instead. This might result in a dismembered, gruesomely damaged zombie that is still moving. Zombies can see in the dark at short range.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fresh&rdquo; zombies are vulnerable to electricity. The first time a zombie takes 5 or more points of damage from an electrical attack, it falls limp and unmoving. Assuming nothing interferes with the process, the zombie arises minutes or hours later without the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Some zombies are infectious. Their bites spread a level 8 disease that moves a victim down one step on the damage track each day a Might defense roll is failed.

Appearances of these colossal creatures are rare events that usually don&rsquo;t last for more than a few days. In that sense, they&rsquo;re akin to hundred-year storms and at least as destructive. When they emerge, they&rsquo;re attracted by artificial structures, the more densely situated and elaborate the better, which they set to smashing with a vengeance. It&rsquo;s hard to judge the size of things so far outside normal scale, but good estimates put most kaiju at over 300 feet (90 m) in height.</p>\n<p>Kaiju rely primarily on their strength and mass, but many have some additional trick or ability that sets them apart from their kin, which usually translates into even more devastation.</p>\n<p>The other quality all kaiju share is the talent of hiding after a rampage by diving into a nearby sea or burrowing deep into the earth.

Kaiju heal quickly, usually at a rate of 2 points per round.</p>\n<p>Kaiju are rare and devastating enough that most are dubbed with a unique identifier by survivors. The entry for each creature below notes only where it varies from the base creature described above.</p>\n<p><em>Rampagion:</em> This kaiju has been estimated to be almost 1,000 feet (300 m) high. Once per day, it can make a charging trample attack, dealing its damage in a line 300 feet (90 m) wide and 2 miles (3 km) long.

Suneko automatically deals 10 points of damage to everyone within immediate range. The creature can emit twin rays of plasma from its eyes in a focused beam that can reach as far as the horizon, which from Suneko&rsquo;s height above the ground is about 22 miles (35 km). When it makes its eyebeam attack, it stops emitting killing heat in immediate range for about one minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Most PCs can&rsquo;t directly interact with a kaiju unless they have some special device or association allowing them to get the attention of one of the massive creatures. Doing so could give the characters a chance to trick or lure the beast, or maybe even persuade one kaiju to fight another.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> After seeing the devastation caused by a kaiju, the PCs might decide (or be asked) to find a way to stop a projected future appearance by the same creature.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The character gains the direct attention of the kaiju.

{"_id":"v5KdQP0xAVsoznyE","name":"Grey","type":"NPC","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"version":1,"biography":"<p>Greys are enigmatic creatures born of alien stars (or dimensions) who have learned to move across the vast distances that bridge neighboring star systems. The creatures descend through the atmosphere under the cover of night to abduct specimens for study and return the victims later after a thorough examination. Returned abductees are usually befuddled and confused, and they retain little memory of what happened to them. Victims of the greys&rsquo; examination frequently sport strange marks on their flesh, oddly shaped wounds, gaps where teeth used to be, and strange or unknown metal lodged somewhere under the skin.</p>\n<p>A grey stands 3 feet (1 m) tall. It has a narrow body with skinny limbs and a large, bulbous head. Two large black eyes, almond shaped, dominate a face that has only a suggestion of a nose and a narrow mouth. Greys wear skintight uniforms, carry numerous instruments to study their environments, and keep a weapon or two for protection.</p>\n<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Knowledge</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Greys land their spacecraft in remote areas, where they have minimal risk of discovery.</p>\n<p><strong>Health:</strong> 12</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 6 points</p>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong> 1</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Short</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> All tasks related to knowledge as level 6; Speed defense as level 5 due to size and quickness</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A grey carries a powerful ray emitter that can burn holes through solid steel. The grey can use the emitter to attack targets within long range. Against dangerous opponents, a grey can use an action to activate a personal shield that encapsulates it in a bubble of force. The shield gives it +3 to Armor, but while the shield is active, the grey can&rsquo;t fire its ray emitter.</p>\n<p>Greys are scientists, but cautious ones. Leaving a trail of corpses as evidence of their existence isn&rsquo;t their preferred mode of operation. For this reason, one grey in every group has a memory eraser. When this grey activates the device, each target other than a grey within short range must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or become stunned for one minute, taking no action (unless attacked, which snaps the victim out of the condition). When the effect wears off naturally, the target has no recollection of encountering little grey creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Greys are curious about the places they visit but reluctant to move or act in the open. Secretive and mysterious, they prefer to observe creatures from afar and, on occasion, pick them up for closer inspection. Someone who offers a grey true knowledge might be treated as an equal rather than a lab animal.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> The PCs are called to investigate a series of disappearances of animals and people. One by one, the abductees return, usually in odd places, and always bearing physical markings that suggest they were subjected to invasive procedures. To protect others from a similar fate, the PCs must catch the abductors in the act.</p>\n<p><strong>Loot:</strong> A grey has one or two cyphers and might have a memory eraser that works as described under Combat (depletion roll of 1&ndash;2 on a 1d10).</p>\n<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> A grey&rsquo;s ray emitter suffers a terrible mishap and explodes. The device kills the grey and destroys its body completely. For the next day, creatures that come within a short distance of where the grey died take 4 points of ambient damage from the psychic radiation each round they remain there.</p>","description":"","health":{"value":12,"max":12},"level":4,"damage":6,"armor":1,"settings":{"initiative":{"initiativeBonus":0},"equipment":{"attacks":false,"cyphers":false,"artifacts":false,"oddities":false,"materials":false,"ammo":false,"armor":false,"materialName":"","cyphersName":"","artifactsName":"","odditiesName":""},"hideArchived":false}},"token":{"name":"Grey","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"health"},"bar2":{"attribute":"level"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"N1n5f3sdQOJFmoJe":3},"flags":{}}
