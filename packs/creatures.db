If the sound is accompanied by a sudden temperature drop and the breath of living creatures begins to steam, it&rsquo;s a certainty.</p>\n<p>Ghosts are the spectral remnants of humans, which persist either as fragments of memory or as full-fledged spirits.

Some ghosts can kill victims with fear. A ghost with this ability can attack all creatures within short range with a psychic display so horrible that targets who fail an Intellect defense roll take 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and become terrified, freezing in place. In each subsequent round, a terrified victim can attempt an Intellect-based task to push away the fright. Each failed attempt moves the victim one step down the damage track. Not attempting to clear one&rsquo;s mind of fear counts as a failed attempt. Those killed by fear are marked by expressions of horror and hair that has turned white.</p>\n<p>A ghost can move through solid objects of up to level 7 at will, although it can choose to pick up and manipulate objects if it focuses on them. Ghosts can also go into a state of apparent non-existence for hours or days at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Some ghosts are talkative, some don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re dead, some want help for a task they failed to accomplish in life, and some only rage against the living and want to bring those who yet breathe into the same colorless existence they endure.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> A ghost (that at first appears fully human) wants help in eradicating a guild of ghost hunters that has targeted it and a few others haunting an abandoned structure. The ghost promises to tell secrets of the afterlife to any who accept its strange offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Loot:</strong> A ghost usually doesn&rsquo;t carry objects, though some might have a keepsake (like an amulet showing the face of a loved one) or an artifact.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The character must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or be possessed by the ghost until they succeed on an Intellect-based task to push it out.

Their very nature and essence are evil and anti-life, even as they revel in their own endless existence. Most vampires are vain, arrogant, sadistic, lustful, and domineering. Their powers allow them to manipulate others, and they frequently toy with their prey before feeding. Vampires come out only at night, as the sun&rsquo;s rays will destroy them.</p>\n<p>The bite of a vampire over three nights (in which it exchanges a bit of its own blood) ensures that the victim will rise as a vampire under the thrall of the one that killed it. While vampires are careful not to create too many of their kind (which amount to competition), each thrall conveys a bit more supernatural power to a vampire.</p>\n<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Thirsts for blood</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Usually solitary, on the edges of civilization</p>\n<p><strong>Health:</strong> 24</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 7 points</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Long</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Climb, stealth, and perception as level 8; Speed defense as level 7 due to fast movement</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> Vampires are strong and fast. They have impressive fangs, but these are usually used in feeding, not in battle. They typically fight with their fists or hands (which basically become claws) but sometimes use weapons.</p>\n<p>A vampire can change into a bat or a wolf. This transformation does not change its stats or abilities except that, as a bat, it can fly. Vampires can also transform into shadow or mist, and in these forms they can&rsquo;t be harmed by anything (but also can&rsquo;t affect the physical world).</p>\n<p>Vampires possess an unholy charisma and can mesmerize victims within immediate distance so that they stand motionless for one round. In subsequent rounds, the victim will not forcibly resist the vampire, and the vampire can suggest actions to the victim (even actions that will cause the victim to harm themselves or others they care about). Each round, the victim can attempt a new Intellect defense roll to break free.</p>\n<p>Vampires are notoriously difficult to hurt. Unless a weapon is very special (blessed by a saint, has specific magical enchantments against vampires, or the like), no physical attack harms a vampire. They simply don&rsquo;t take the damage. Exceptions include the following:</p>\n<p><em>Fire:</em> Vampires burn, though the damage doesn&rsquo;t kill them. It only causes pain, and a vampire regains all health lost to fire damage within a day.</p>\n<p><em>Running water:</em> Complete immersion inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire can use a single action to regain all health lost in this way.</p>\n<p><em>Holy water:</em> This inflicts 4 points of damage and affects a vampire exactly like fire.</p>\n<p><em>Sunlight:</em> Exposure to sunlight inflicts 10 points of damage per round. If not destroyed, the vampire regains all health lost to exposure within a day.</p>\n<p><em>Wooden stake:</em> This weapon inflicts 25 points of damage, effectively destroying the vampire in one blow. However, if the vampire is aware and able to move, this attack is hindered as the vampire does everything it can to evade.</p>\n<p>Further, vampires have the following special weaknesses:</p>\n<p><em>Garlic:</em> Significant amounts of garlic within immediate distance hinder a vampire&rsquo;s tasks.</p>\n<p><em>Cross, holy symbol, or mirror:</em> Presenting any of these objects forcefully stuns a vampire, causing it to lose its next action. While the object is brandished and the vampire is within immediate range, its tasks are hindered by two steps.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a vampire with a multitude under its command becomes the new vampire lord. The vampire lord is the most powerful vampire in the world and is often (but not always) the most ancient of its kind.

Leapfrogging technological prowess by mentally commandeering the know-how of every new species they encountered using their stolen space vessel, the aliens fashioned the Enthraller Dominion, which stretches across vast swaths of space, cemented by the psychic control.</p>\n<p>Individual enthrallers are scary, but enthraller overlords are even more powerful thanks to technological aids. These include cranial circlets that give a single enthraller governor the ability to dominate a small city, solar-system-sized ring relays that boost their control across interstellar distances, and more.</p>\n<p>Recently, a newly contacted species of aliens developed the technological means to resist the mental influence of the enthrallers. Now war bubbles across the Enthraller Dominion. Sometimes individual enthrallers, stripped of their technological enhancements as a consequence of this war, flee into virgin space, looking for new soldiers to dominate.</p>\n<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Domination of other creatures</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Almost anywhere, alone or in groups of three</p>\n<p><strong>Health:</strong> 18</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 4 points; see Combat</p>\n<p><strong>Armor:</strong> 1</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Short</p>\n<p><strong>Modifications:</strong> Speed defense as level 4; perception and ability to detect falsehoods as level 8</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> An enthraller usually relies on dominated minions to make physical attacks on its behalf. An enthraller can make a psychic attack on a creature within short range. On a failed Intellect defense roll, the target acts as the enthraller mentally commands on its next action. If the same target is affected by this dominating attack a second time within a minute, the enthraller&rsquo;s mental control lasts for one minute.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, as its action, an enthraller can emit a psychic burst that can target up to three creatures in short range. On a failed Intellect defense roll, a victim suffers 4 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and is unable to take actions on their subsequent turn. If the victim is attacked while so stunned, their defense rolls are hindered by two steps.</p>\n<p>The enthraller&rsquo;s attack is a form of mental feeding. If it moves a PC down the damage track, the creature regains 4 points of health.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> An enthraller can communicate telepathically with characters within short range. It tries to mentally dominate whoever it runs across and will negotiate only with characters who are strong enough to harm it. Even if an enthraller makes a deal, it eventually reneges if it senses any advantage for doing so because it implicitly believes that other creatures are cattle.</p>\n<p><strong>Use:</strong> A spacecraft (or perhaps an escape pod) crash lands. Inside, a hurt enthraller lies in suspended animation. Investigators are unlikely to realize the enthraller&rsquo;s nature beforehand, but they certainly learn if they wake the alien.</p>\n<p><strong>Loot:</strong> Enthrallers wear light armor suited for their forms. They might have one or two cyphers and, rarely, an artifact that boosts their already-fearsome mental capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>GM Intrusion:</strong> The enthraller&rsquo;s intrusion into the character&rsquo;s mind stirs up forgotten memories.

The creature can emit twin rays of plasma from its eyes in a focused beam that can reach as far as the horizon, which from Suneko&rsquo;s height above the ground is about 22 miles (35 km).

The statues, ranging in size from birds to warriors astride steeds, all depict creatures in states of fright and pain, the final image of death. These pieces are not the work of a fevered mind, but the fates of those who braved a gorgon&rsquo;s lair.</p>\n<p>Gorgons were humans once. After they offended the gods with their vanity, they were transformed into hideous monsters. A gorgon has the upper body of a human of perfect form and physique, but the lower body of a giant serpent, complete with rattling tail. One who dares look at a gorgon&rsquo;s face can see traces of the old beauty beneath a weary veneer, darkened by hatred. Instead of hair, serpents crown a gorgon&rsquo;s head, snapping and hissing at anyone who draws near. Yet the most terrible aspect of a gorgon is its gaze, which can turn any creature to stone.</p>\n<p><strong>Motive:</strong> Isolation, defense</p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong> Alone, sequestered in the isolated ruins of old cities and castles</p>\n<p><strong>Health:</strong> 12</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Inflicted:</strong> 5 points</p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Short</p>\n<p><strong>Combat:</strong> A gorgon has a long-range bow attack.

As part of the action the gorgon uses to attack, the serpents on its head can also attack one target within immediate distance. A target that fails its Speed defense roll takes 2 points of damage from the bite and must immediately make a Might defense roll to resist the poison (which deals 4 additional points of Speed damage that ignores Armor).</p>\n<p>Anyone within short range of a gorgon who meets its gaze and fails a Might defense roll turns to stone. In combat, when a character within short distance attacks the gorgon, they must avert their gaze (which hinders the attack by two steps) or make a Might defense roll.

The creatures descend through the atmosphere under the cover of night to abduct specimens for study and return the victims later after a thorough examination. Returned abductees are usually befuddled and confused, and they retain little memory of what happened to them. Victims of the greys&rsquo; examination frequently sport strange marks on their flesh, oddly shaped wounds, gaps where teeth used to be, and strange or unknown metal lodged somewhere under the skin.</p>\n<p>A grey stands 3 feet (1 m) tall. It has a narrow body with skinny limbs and a large, bulbous head. Two large black eyes, almond shaped, dominate a face that has only a suggestion of a nose and a narrow mouth.

The shield gives it +3 to Armor, but while the shield is active, the grey can&rsquo;t fire its ray emitter.</p>\n<p>Greys are scientists, but cautious ones. Leaving a trail of corpses as evidence of their existence isn&rsquo;t their preferred mode of operation. For this reason, one grey in every group has a memory eraser. When this grey activates the device, each target other than a grey within short range must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or become stunned for one minute, taking no action (unless attacked, which snaps the victim out of the condition). When the effect wears off naturally, the target has no recollection of encountering little grey creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction:</strong> Greys are curious about the places they visit but reluctant to move or act in the open. Secretive and mysterious, they prefer to observe creatures from afar and, on occasion, pick them up for closer inspection.
