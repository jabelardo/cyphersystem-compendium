This is a module for use in conjunction with the [Cypher System game system for Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem/). The Cypher System Compendium expands the Cypher System game system with compendia full of equipment, cyphers, and abilities.

The content is crowd-sourced by the Cypher and Foundry VTT community. I’ll submit this module to the Foundry database when it has more content. Until then follow these steps to install it:

1. Open Foundry VTT and open “Add-on Modules.”
2. Click on “Install Module.”
3. Copy the following URL into the Manifest URL filed at the bottom of the window: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-compendium/main/module.json
4. Click on “Install.”

## Support

I appreciate any feedback and questions. You can reach me on Discord (@mrkwnzl#7407). If the Cypher System Compendium makes your games more accessible and fun, I’m grateful for your support:

## Contributing

If you want to contribute with your own compendium packs, you can do that. In order to contribute, you need to create a Compendium in Foundry VTT and send me the .db-file of that compendium. Follow these steps (from the [https://foundryvtt.com/article/compendium/](Foundry VTT knowledge base)):

### Exporting

**Step 1 - Building the Compendium**

- Make sure you have updated the Cypher System game system to at least version 1.6.1.
- Create your Compendium (in Foundry VTT).
- Drag and drop each entity you want to add to your Compendium into the just created Compendium. Please make sure that you follow the rules for the items we can use in this module (see below).

**Step 3 - Sending me the Compendium**

- Using your Operating System's File Browser, access your UserData folder, then the Worlds folder (./Data/worlds/).
- Locate and open the folder for the World that you created the Compendium in.
- Open the packs folder (./Data/worlds/yourworldnamehere/packs/).
- This folder will contain a file with a .db extension. If you named your compendium “my actors” it will be my-actors.db. Send me this file, either via Discord (@mrkwnzl#7407) or here in GitHub.

### Rules for Compendium Packs

The [Fan Use Policy](https://www.montecookgames.com/fan-support/fan-use-policy/) only allows the use of game terms and associated numerical values, so we can’t use the official material from any of the books published by MCG (or any other trademarked material, for that matter). That means we can only use generic or self-made equipment, Cyphers, Artifacts, Oddities, NPCs, and creatures.

Please use the images that ship with Foundry VTT or images you own (which are most certainly images you created yourself) for your items. If you use the images from Foundry VTT, you don’t need to do anything else. IF you use other images, please contact be forehand, so that we can take a look.
